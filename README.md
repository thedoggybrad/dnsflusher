# TheDoggyBrad's DNS Cache Flusher for Windows
TheDoggyBrad's DNS Cache Flusher for Windows helps you flush your dns cache easily by just pressing the enter key or the buttons 1 or 2.
<br>
Flushing your DNS cache helps you to fix 404 errors and problems related to your DNS cache not up to date.
<br>
Note: Flushing your DNS will make its first time load much slower, but next time, it will load the same as before.
<br>
Compatible for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 and their Windows Server and LTSC counterparts.

## .CMD vs .BAT (What are these?)
*CMD files have the current version of Microsoft language while BAT has the older version of the Microsoft language.
<br>
*CMD is backward compatible while BAT is not backward compatible.
<br>
*CMD runs in most command.com scripts whereas BAT by itself will not run in command.com scripts unless made to do so.
<br>
*CMD has improved scripting because it is developed for Windows NT. BAT scripts are older version as it is developed for DOS command prompt.
<br>
*CMD is much safer than BAT file format.

## Future Plans (RoadMap)
1.) Make a Release that runs on Microsoft/Windows PowerShell. Right now this software only runs via CMD.
<br>
2.) Make a GUI-based app to easily flush your dns. Right now only commandline is being used.
<br>
<br>
Note: All of these future plans may or may not be implemented in this software.
