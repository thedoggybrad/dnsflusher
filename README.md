## How everything is built and how I can modify or view the code?
### CMD/BAT File
It is built using the traditional Windows NotePad, but you can view/modify the code using other Notepads such as NotePad++. The .bat filenruns on COMMAND.COM (via NTVDM) or CMD.EXE and .cmd runs only on CMD.EXE.
### PS1 File
It is built from Windows PowerShell ISE and modified a bit using NotePad, to modify the code use either PowerShell ISE or Notepad applications. It runs on both Windows PowerShell (.NET Framework) and Microsoft PowerShell (.NET Core)
### Portable EXE/SETUP ZIP
It is built using Visual Basic 2015. To view/modify the code just open the project (.sln) file on Visual Basic 2015 or higher (not lower). This runs on .NET Framework 2.0 but you can change it in Visual Basic's Application Options.
