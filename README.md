# TheDoggyBrad's DNS Cache Flusher for Windows
*TheDoggyBrad's DNS Cache Flusher for Windows helps you flush your dns cache easily by just pressing the enter key or the buttons 1 or 2 or by using the new Visual Basic app.
<br>
*Flushing your DNS cache helps you to fix 404 errors and problems related to your DNS cache not up to date.

*Note: Flushing your DNS will make its first time load much slower, but next time, it will load the same as before.
<br>
*Compatible for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 and their Windows Server and LTSC counterparts (GUI, CMD, BAT).
<br>

## Future Plans (RoadMap)

Note: All of these future plans may or may not be implemented in this software.
